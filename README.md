# Roads-Turns-Detection
 In my road turn detection project for Gilgit city, I used YOLOv5 to identify road turns through video analysis, without GPS data. Gilgit's mountainous terrain has many sharp curves, making navigation challenging. This system offering drivers valuable guidance to navigate the region's unique and often tricky roads.
